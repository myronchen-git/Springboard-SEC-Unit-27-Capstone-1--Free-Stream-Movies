Create a website that replaces the archaic and slow steam trade window.  There seems to be a way to get inventory items, but the trade offer POST request may not work.

==================================================================================

1)
It is difficult to find what movies are available to be streamed for free.  Users can visit individual websites like Tubi, Plex, and Amazon Prime Video and go through their lists, but information is fragmented.

Create a website that consolidates lists of all the free movies across multiple platforms.  Data will include movie titles, covers, and streaming platforms.  It should include searching, and filtering by release date and etc.  It might include watchlisting and email notification of when a particular movie becomes free.

2)
Traditional restaurant menus often do not have pictures displaying menu items.  People have to guess what the food is like, from the list of ingredients.  Sometimes the menu is in a different language too.  Pictures help to quickly allow people to determine if the food is something they will like.  Yelp provides this feature, but the pictures are usually not labeled properly or follow a consistent standard.

My website will allow users to search for a restaurant, display each menu item and their ingredients (if available), and provide that info in as many languages as possible.  A new API would need to be created, with most content being provided by users (community driven).  It might include allowing users to rate photos.  Data will also include restaurant information, such as location and phone number.

3)
E-commerce Platform

Description: Develop a simple e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to cart, and checkout. Use Flask for backend logic, PostgreSQL for product and order data, and integrate with a payment gateway API (like Stripe API).

==================================================================================

In Streaming Availability API:
Use "Get Changes" endpoint to get movies that were free in the past and movies that will be free soon.

Allow users to search TMDB for any movie for viewing movie info, free or not, and if not free, allow users to put into watchlist.

Front page will display rows of websites (tubitv, pluto tv, freevee, youtube) and the free movies on those websites.
